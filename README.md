# Rat Party Mix Discord Music Bot

Discord music bot for my [playlist on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0RHhiQ6hGLKgjE7eqNdXzh), that has couple of specific commands just to integrate with this playlist (made possible with help of Spotify API).
It can of course play any other music track using [Lavaplayer](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/lavaplayer) that uses YouTube API for streaming and searching tracks. Branded with the name of the playlist just for fun.

## About the playlist

The playlist was created back when I was in high school. It features party hits mainly from years late 2000s and early 2010s (I love 'white girls' music btw) mixed with some recent popular tracks.
I recommend it as a ready-to-go playlist for parties if someone didn't have one already and I acted like it's some real brand (I still do) and it's kinda fun. 
Then I combined this idea with my programming skills and created this bot as a side project. <br>

A friend of mine also got hooked to this idea and created a bot 'tracker' ([Github](https://github.com/zawislakm/RatPartyMixTracker)) for this playlist. This bot notifies followers whenever the tracklist on Spotify 
is updated and shares a randomly chosen daily song at 12PM (CET) via Twitter everyday. Additionally, it is also possible to fetch daily song directly from [RatPartMix API](http://130.61.63.141:8888/docs).

Another friend aka Zuzanna top G - is making thumbnails every year for the playlist using her Photoshop skills. (they kinda fireðŸ”¥)
